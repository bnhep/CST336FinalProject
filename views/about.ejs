            This project is a collaboration between teammates, combining design, backend logic,
            and database integration.
          </p>
          <p>
            The goal is to create a site where users can learn about famous cryptids
            and log their own sightings &ndash; while we demonstrate authentication, CRUD operations,
            and modern front-end styling (TODO: fix wording later).
          </p>
          <p>
            Add later: team member bios?? (would be funny if we made fake ones), technical stack details,
            and links to any external APIs or data sources used.
