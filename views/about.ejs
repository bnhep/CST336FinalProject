            Cryptids are animals or creatures that have been claimed to exist but have never been scientifically proven to exit. 
            These beings often originate from folklore, eyewitness accounts, and local legends, and are typically reported 
            in remote or unexplored regions of the world. Well known examples include Sasquatch, the Loch Ness Monster, 
            the Chupacabra, and the Mothman.

            While many cryptid sightings are explained as misidentifications, hoaxes, or natural phenomena, cryptids continue 
            to capture public interest because they exist at the boundary between science and mythology. They raise questions 
            about how much of the natural world remains undiscovered and how human perception, storytelling, and culture shape 
            our understanding of the unknown.

            The study and discussion of cryptids is often referred to as cryptozoology. This is not a replacement for scientific research, however
            cryptozoology offers an alternative insight into human curiosity, regional traditions, and the enduring appeal of mystery.
